Q: Why is it that no matter how hard I try, I still fail?  
A: 

It depends on whose perspective you want to get.

A
pessimist would say that your objectives are too high and unreachable. 
An optimist would say that reaching your objectives is simply a matter 
of time and distance. You just need to exert the required amount of 
effort to get you from where you are to where you want to be, given the 
right direction.

A pessimist would say that you don't have the necessary knowledge and skills to achieve your objective. An optimist would
say that knowledge and skills are simply tools to reach your 
objectives. Anybody can learn new knowledge and gain new skills whenever
they want. You may not learn as fast as the other person, but if you 
really try, you WILL gain those tools.

A pessimist would say that your efforts are fruitless and result to nothing. An optimist would say that even if you don't
achieve your objectives now, you can use the experiences that you 
gained from that attempt in making better decisions and helping you 
achieve your objectives tomorrow.

A pessimist would say that your
objectives are simply not meant for you. An optimist would say that you
only fail when you stop trying.
